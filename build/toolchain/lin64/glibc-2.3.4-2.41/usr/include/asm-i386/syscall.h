 * Prototypes for architecture-specific Linux syscalls.

 *	it might be a good idea to collect all in one place.
 *  - maybe this could be automatically generated from some kind of
 *	master file (like BSD's syscalls.master), so it is always coherent
 *	to the actual syscalls (which may as well be arch-specific).
